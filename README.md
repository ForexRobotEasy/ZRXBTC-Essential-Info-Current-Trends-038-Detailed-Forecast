This code is a sample implementation of a trading robot for the ZRXBTC cryptocurrency pair. It connects to a cryptocurrency exchange API, retrieves real-time market data, analyzes market trends and sentiment, and identifies potential trading opportunities based on predefined criteria.

## Libraries and Dependencies
The code includes the following libraries and dependencies:
- `Trade.mqh`: for trading functions
- `ArrayObj.mqh`: for array manipulation
- `ChartObjectText.mqh`: for visualization

## Global Variables
The code defines the following global variables:
- `riskPercentage`: the risk percentage for position sizing
- `stopLossPercentage`: the stop-loss percentage for risk management
- `trailingStopPercentage`: the trailing stop percentage for risk management

## Trading Function
The main trading function `tradeZRXBTC()` performs the following steps:
1. Connects to the cryptocurrency exchange API.
2. Retrieves real-time market data for the ZRXBTC pair.
3. Analyzes market trends and sentiment using helper functions `calculateBitcoinDominance()` and `calculateZRXSentiment()`.
4. Identifies trading opportunities based on predefined criteria.
5. Calculates the order quantity based on the risk percentage.
6. Places a buy order with the calculated position size, stop-loss price, and take-profit price.
7. Tracks and manages the portfolio by calculating portfolio performance using `calculatePortfolioPerformance()` and displaying it with `displayPortfolioPerformance()`.
8. Disconnects from the cryptocurrency exchange API.

## Helper Functions
The code includes the following helper functions:
- `calculateBitcoinDominance()`: calculates the bitcoin dominance percentage.
- `calculateZRXSentiment()`: calculates the ZRX sentiment value.
- `calculatePortfolioPerformance()`: calculates the portfolio performance value.
- `displayPortfolioPerformance()`: visualizes the portfolio performance value on the chart.

## Entry Point and Main Program Execution
The code defines the entry point of the trading robot in the `OnInit()` function. It also includes the `OnDeinit()` function for cleanup tasks. The `OnTick()` function contains the trading logic, which calls the `tradeZRXBTC()` function. Finally, the `OnStart()` function starts the trading robot and executes the `OnTick()` function in a loop until the program is stopped.
